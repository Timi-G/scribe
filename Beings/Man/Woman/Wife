A wife is supposed to be a guide for the man like the Holy Ghost but the decision of the man is his and he stirs the boat and the wife is tasked to advise and guide. Oh wife, do you advise your husband correctly or all your desires are carnal and will lead Adam to eat of the Tree of good and evil because it pleased your eyes. This is why a man must be discerning of when to take his woman's counsel but ideally he should always take counsel from her that is one with the spirit.
