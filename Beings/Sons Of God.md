What humanity is doing with Technology and other innovations is to catch up with other sons of God. Bible teaches us that when the sons of God laid with the daughter of them they gave birth and these children were the great men of old, men of renown (these men were perhaps sometimes is obscured in myth) (Genesis 6:4).

And so the believer is given power to become a son of God. If he engages this power, he will manifest even as sons of God do. Jesus also said such a fellow will do greater works than Him because He goeth to the Father. None of the other sons of God could save humanity or bring us back to fellowship with God. When they had the opportunity to, some came in to the daughters of men and knew them. But God Himself as Jesus came and saved us. Hallelujah ‚úãüèº üôèüèºüôåüèº

How do sons of God manifest: Look at the life of Jesus, they walk on water, they can heal the sickness and diseases, they have authority over principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, spiritual wickedness in high places. Paul says we wrestle against these yet more than conquerors are we through Christ, the Son of God that loved us and gave His life for us (Gal. 2:20). Jesus came to show us what it is like to be a Son of God and to give us power to become so too.

What the other sons of God will be like....(Holy Ghost will reveal) but for us sons of men, when Christ comes, we shall be like Him for we will see Him as He is

Jesus did not come to make us one of the princes, He said that we are gods and everyone of us children of the Most High. For God standeth in the congregation of the mighty ones. We are the mighty ones. Anyone that does not manifest according to whom God has made them to be will die like men or one of the princes because who God has called us to be furnishes us with responsibilities and duties. For example, if you are a father, there are responsibilities that come with being a father, likewise a mother and a son.

The princes will die, an example of a prince is the prince of Persia.
