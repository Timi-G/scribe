How do you preserve a new creature. Some of the self preservation techniques taught are for the old (man). Many of the things that a new creature must do to survive are opposite that of the old, just like different species might need different self-preservation skills.

The creature must be brave and learn to run towards what other creatures might term as danger even as lead by the Spirit of God. To him it is necessary preservation techniques
- David ran towards Goliath (1 Samuel 4:38), hence preserving the Israelites when he killed Goliath.
- David runs to a troop and leaps over a wall by God (2 Samuel 23:30, Psalm 18:29)
- The New creature is not and cannot afford to be afraid of death. As fearing death is a bringer of slavery (Hebrews 2:15). For a new creature not to be enslaved, he must be unafraid of death, and so the new creature must learn to walkn into death threatening situations as by God (Acts 21:4, 11-15) Paul went to Jerusalem regardless of knowing what others call unpleasant that was to come upon him there.
